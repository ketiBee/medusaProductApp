 Storefront that displays products in a grid (landing page) and allows customers to visit a details page for each product.
 
 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
 Given time for this project was perfect duration to make this project step by step. Getting to know Medusa server was the first part of the project and its connection to the frontend. When connection was made it was time to implement parts of the project. Project was structured in the way that first step was GET request to get all products from server and display them in products page. There are different pages and components to make project with modular component-based approach.
 
 The most time spent was when I was doing a page where details of products should be displayed because Next.js was updated and server-side rendering of pages was updated as well to the new concept. Therefore, a lot of time was spent to figure out that new way of rendering. 
 The most difficult part of the project was allowing user to be able to choose between variants of products because of structure of products and because of different values of variants. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to make that user can choose both size and color of product at the same time, specifically, T-shirt product has variants of values size and color, therefore user can only choose one of the options displayed. Even though I tried to fix that issue for days with different options, I couldn't.

Even though projects has its flaws( as I mentioned it above) I'm stisfied with the process of making it and learning a lot of new concepts with Next.js and Medusa server.
